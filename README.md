# MY RESUME
 
This is my professional programming resume. It is still under construction and will continue to be edited as I am progressively learning more programming languages, frameworks and gaining relevant work experience. This was a task to be submitted as part of the HNG Internship. It is only about a month into my active coding/coding at all...

This is a responsive, beautifully designed resume with embedded links(tap words) to HNG Internship, Visiola Foundation and my social media pages... Also there is neat particioning for better asthestic and organisation
